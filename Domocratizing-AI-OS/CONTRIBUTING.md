5. Submit a pull request

## Development Process

### Git Workflow

1. **Branch Naming**
   - Features: `feature/description`
   - Bugs: `fix/description`
   - Documentation: `docs/description`

2. **Commit Messages**
   ```
   type(scope): description

   [optional body]

   [optional footer]
   ```
   Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

3. **Pull Requests**

2. **Project-Specific Standards**
   - Keep kernel code minimal
   - Prefer message passing over shared memory
   - Use type system for safety
   - Document safety assumptions

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test each module independently
   - Use mock objects when needed
   - Aim for high coverage

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test component interactions
