## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Democratizing AI OS seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

1. **Do Not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

2. Email your findings to security@democratizingai.org. Encrypt your email using our [PGP key](https://keys.openpgp.org) if the vulnerability is sensitive.

3. Include the following information in your report:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full path of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the vulnerability and how it could be exploited

### What to Expect

After you submit a vulnerability report:

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.

2. We will provide a more detailed response within 72 hours, indicating next steps in handling your report.

3. We will keep you informed about our progress in fixing the vulnerability.

4. We will notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed.

### Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not offer a bug bounty program, but we deeply appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any security issues.

## Security Best Practices

When developing for or using Democratizing AI OS:

1. **Keep Your Environment Secure**
   - Use the latest stable version
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
   - Use secure configurations for development tools
   - Enable security features like ASLR, DEP, etc.

2. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding guidelines
   - Use memory-safe constructs
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use safe APIs and avoid unsafe blocks where possible
   - Document security considerations in your code

3. **Runtime Security**
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Enable security-related logging
   - Monitor system resources
   - Keep sensitive data encrypted

4. **Network Security**
   - Use secure protocols
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit
   - Follow network security best practices

## Known Security Gaps and Future Improvements

We are actively working on improving the following security aspects:

1. **Memory Protection**
   - Implementing better memory isolation between processes
   - Enhancing the MMU configuration
   - Adding memory encryption for sensitive data

2. **Process Isolation**
   - Improving process boundary enforcement
   - Implementing capability-based security
   - Adding sandboxing features

3. **Network Security**
   - Adding built-in firewall capabilities
   - Implementing secure boot
   - Adding network encryption by default

4. **AI Security**
   - Implementing model isolation
   - Adding AI workload validation
   - Implementing secure AI inference

## Security-Related Configuration

For secure deployment, we recommend:

1. **Hardware Security**
   ```toml
   [security.hardware]
   secure_boot = true
   tpm_enabled = true
   memory_encryption = true
   ```

2. **Process Security**
   ```toml
   [security.process]
   aslr = true
   dep = true
   stack_protector = true
   ```

3. **Network Security**
   ```toml
   [security.network]
   firewall = true
   encrypted_protocols_only = true
   secure_dns = true
   ```

4. **AI Security**
   ```toml
   [security.ai]
   model_validation = true
   secure_inference = true
   data_encryption = true
   ```
